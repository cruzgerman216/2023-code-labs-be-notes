**Congratulations, you did it! You've worked so hard to get to this point and now we can incorporate everything we've learned to create a Full Stack Angular and Rails Project!**


## READ BEFORE STARTING

**Publish project to GitHub and commit frequently**<br>

## Requirements

- Must have a project theme
- Separate the Front End Angular Project and Back End Rails Application into two separate repositories in GitHub
- Have at least three resources (also, three DB tables)
- Your Front End must incorporate the routing feature so the client can navigate to different views of your Application
- Your Front End Application must make requests to your Rails API
  - Example
    1. A user clicks on a button that says "Get Books" 
    2. Your Front End Application will then send a request to your API 
    3. Your API receives the request, gets books from DB and sends it to your Front End 
    4. The Front End receives the response and does something on the client
- Both Applications must be deployed (heroku, firebase, Railway, ect)

- Create a video showing off your project. Go through your deployed application as well as your code. This should be no more than 10 minutes. 
  - Title the video `Project-name - Code Labs 2022-23 Full Stack Angular and Rails Project`
    - Audio is required
    - Camera is optional
