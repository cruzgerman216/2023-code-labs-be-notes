## READ BEFORE STARTING

**Use Git or GitHub Desktop to commit each exercise to GitHub** <br>

**Use a cloud based service or an IDE**<br>

**Exercise 2.1: Define a method** <br>
Create a ruby file called exercise-2.1.rb.

- Define a method called say_hello_to. When you call the method, you should be able to see `Hello, John Doe!` in the console.
- Add a parameter called name to the method you just created. Use the parameter to print out `Hello, ` follow by the parameter name. Use string interpolation to do this.
- Outside of the say_hello_to method, create a constant variable called MY_NAME and set it to your name.
- Call the method and add the MY_NAME variable as an argument.

Result:

```
> Hello, John
```

**Exercise 2.2: Multiple Methods** <br>
Create a ruby file called exercise-2.2.rb. Copy and paste the following:

```ruby

def favorite_movie(movie)
    # TODO: use string interpolation to print "My favorite movie is " and include the movie parameter.
end

def favorite_food(food)
    # TODO: use string interpolation to print "My favorite food is " and include the food parameter.
end

def favorite_drink(drink)
    # TODO: use string interpolation to print "My favorite drink is " and include the drink parameter.
end

def list_of_favorite_things(movie, food, drink)
    # TODO: Call favorite_movie, pass in the parameter movie as an argument
    # TODO: Call favorite_food, pass in the parameter food as an argument
    # TODO: Call favorite_drink, pass in the parameter drink as an argument

end

# TODO: Call list_of_favorite_things, include three arguments
```

- Read each comment and complete each task.

Result:

```
> My favorite movie is The Thing
> My favorite food is spaghetti
> My favorite drink is water
```

**Exercise 2.3: Define a method with multiple arguments** <br>
Create a ruby file called exercise-2.3.rb.

- Define a method called names_of_my_pets. Add three parameters to the method: name_1, name_2, name_3.
- When calling the method, this should be the expected result:

```
> I have 3 pets! Their names are Apollo, Athena and Loki!
```

**Exercise 2.4: Use built in string methods** <br>
Create a ruby file called exercise-2.4.rb.

- Create a variable called sentence and set it to `Hello John Doe!`. Use the built-in string method `sub` to replace `Hello` with `Hi`. If you don't know how to use `sub`, I suggest Googling it. Print out the result.
- Create a variable called solution and set it to `Hi John Doe!`. Use the built-in string method `match?` to compare it with the variable sentence. Print the result and you should get `true` in the console.

Result:

```
> Hi John Doe!
> true
```

**Exercise 2.5: Built in String methods** <br>
Create a ruby file called exercise-2.5.rb.
Go through the [ruby documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.0/String.html#method-i-next). Use 5 built in string methods. Here's an example of using the string method `length`.

```ruby
name = "John"
puts "I have #{name.length} characters in my name."
```

**Exercise 2.6: More built in array methods** <br>
Create a Ruby file called exercise-2.6.rb.

1. Print out the array built in methods

To see the methods
Example `puts [].methods`

1. Create an array that includes three strings that resemble names: "Amy", "Jimmy", "Johnny"
2. Use three different built in array methods that haven't been used today. Googling is recommended.

**Exercise 2.7: Arrays and iterators** <br>
Create a Ruby file called exercise-2.7.rb.

1. Create an array with numbers 1 through 10
2. Print out the first element of the array, the last element and its length.
3. Use `unshift` to add a number to the front of the array. Use `<<` to push a number to the end of the array.
4. Use a loop to print out each element of the array.
5. While iterating, multiply each number by 2.
6. If the result of the multiplication is an even number, print the result follow by ` is a even number`.
7. If the result of the multiplication is an odd number, print the result follow by ` is a odd number`. Note: multiplying any number by 2 will always result as an even number so if you do get a print out of "..is a odd number", you might want to check your code.
8. Repeat lines 4-7 except, instead of a loop, use the built-in array method `select`.

**Exercises 2.8: Hashes** <br>
Create a Ruby file called exercise-2.8.rb.

1. Set a variable called user to a hash with keys email and id. Store values for these keys.
2. Print the values with keys `email` and `id`.
3. Choose and use three built in hash methods onto this object.

To see the methods
`puts {}.methods`

Googling is recommended.

**Exercise 2.9: Basic class** <br>
Create a Ruby file called exercise-2.9.rb.

1. Define a class called `Box`
2. Create three new `Box` instances.
3. Print each oox instance.

Output

```
> #<Box:0x00007fa5820e6508>
> #<Box:0x00007fa58294a730>
> #<Box:0x00007fa5850276c8>
```

**Exercise 2.10: Operators**<br>
Create a ruby file called exercise-2.10.rb

Create a class called calculator. Create four class methods: add, subtract, divide and multiply. Each method should have two parameters. Each method should do a basic level of an expression involving a certain operator and the given two parameters. For example, in the `add` method, you will use the `+` to evaluate the addition of both parameters. Execute each method to make sure they all work.

**Exercise 2.11: Animal class** <br>
Create a Ruby file called exercise-2.11.rb.

1. Define a class called `Animal` and set attributes `name`, `animal_type` and `color` using the method attr_accessors (keep in mind, attributes refer to instance variables).
2. Initialize an Animal instance and store it in a variable called dog.
3. Access attributes `name` in dog and set it to "Clifford". Fill in the rest of the attributes.
4. Print out each attribute `dog` contains.
5. Create an instance method called `intro`. When you call `intro`, it should print `Hey, my name is Clifford. I'm red and I am a dog` to the console. Use string interpolation to do this.

Output

```
> Hey, my name is Clifford.
> I am a dog.
> My fur color is red.
```

**Exercise 2.12: Rectangle class** <br>
Create a Ruby file called exercise-2.12.rb.

1. Define a class called `Rectangle` with attributes `length` and `width`.
2. Define an instance method called `area`. This method should return the multiplication of `length` and `width`.
3. Define an instance method called `perimeter`. This should return the addition of all sides of the "rectangle". Refer to the mathematical formula below:
4. Call area and perimeter. This involves creating an instance and filling it's attributes width and length.

```
w + w + l + l
```

w refers to width
l refers to length

**Exercise 2.13: Human class** <br>
Create a Ruby file called exercise-2.13.rb.

1. Define a class called `Person` and set instance variables `name` and `age` using the method attr_accessors.
2. Define an initialize method that will set each attribute.
3. Create a class variable called `people` that is set to an empty array.
4. Every time an instance gets created, push that instance in the class variable people. Do so in the initialize method.
5. Create a class method called `print_all_people`. Loop through people and print each name and age in the format of `"Name: John Doe, Age: 54"`. Call this method to see if the results are correct.

**Exercise 2.14: Class inheritance** <br>
Create a Ruby file called exercise-2.14.rb.

1. Define four classes: `Person`, `Doctor`, `Teacher` and `Engineer`.
2. In the Person class, define an instance method called `eat` with a parameter called food. This method should print out "Eating " follow by the parameter.
3. In `Person`, create attributes `weight`, `height`, `name`.
4. In `Person`, define an initialize method and set these attributes by passing in arguments upon instantiation.
5. Make `Doctor`, `Teacher`, and `Engineer` inherit from `Person`.
6. For each class except Person, upon instantiation, print out "I am a " follow by the type of profession this person is in.
   For example, "I am a Doctor!".

**Exercise 2.15: Modules** <br>
Create a Ruby file called exercise-2.15.rb

1. Define a class called Person.
2. Define a module called Traits. In the module, define a method called eat and print out "Eating".
3. Include the module in the Person class. Allow each person instance to call these methods the module gives.

_It's important to remember that your ability to solve algorithmic problems is distinct from your ability to develop software. During technical job interviews, you may be asked to solve coding challenges as a way to evaluate your skills._

### Add Strings [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/)

**I won't go easy on you...**

```
Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.
In this case you can't use to_i.
```

Example 1: <br>

Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123" <br>
Output: "134" <br>
Example 2: <br>

Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77" <br>
Output: "533" <br>
Example 3: <br>

Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0" <br>
Output: "0" <br>

### Two Sum [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

**Good job on the last question, let's see if you can figure this one out!**

```
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
```

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 <br>
Output: [0,1] <br>
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]. <br>

Example 2: <br>

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6 <br>
Output: [1,2] <br>

Example 3: <br>

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6 <br>
Output: [0,1] <br>

### Linked list

**You're tough if you made it this far.**

```
Create a linked list in Ruby.

Then, create a doubly linked list.
```
